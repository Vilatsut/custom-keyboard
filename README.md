# Firmware for a hand soldered 60TKL keyboard
This repository contains the firmware I used to flash my **Arduino Pro Micro** that was handsoldered to 60TKL amount of switches.

I used QMK configurator to create the layout and firmware:

Then I used QMK toolbox to flash the firmware on the Arduino micro
